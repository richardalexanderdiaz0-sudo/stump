Frequently asked questions about the mobile app

## Pricing

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
	The price has yet to be determined and **subject to change**. I am trying to keep it as affordable
	as possible while still being sustainable for continued development. The current price range I'm
	considering is between $10 and $20 USD, which is comparable to similar apps in the market.
</Callout>

Once the app is more stable and feature-complete, it will be released as a paid app on both iOS and Android. The price is not finalized, but it will be a one-time purchase with **no required recurring fees or subscriptions** that otherwise gate features.

The app will remain free for alpha testers via TestFlight and Google Play, however it will be used as a testing ground for new features and changes before they are released to the public. Therefore, alpha testers should expect more bugs and instability compared to the paid version.

## Why React Native?

React Native is often criticized for its performance and reliability, but it has come a long way since its inception. Stump is primarily developed and maintained by a single person, so it is important to consider the trade-offs between performance and development overhead.

Regardless, I am confident that it is at least a good fit for Stump, as it is a relatively simple app with a focus on content consumption - which doesn't inherently require a lot of performance.

## Will there be translations?

Yes! The app will be translated into multiple languages in the same way the web app is. I plan to start this effort once the app is more stable and feature-complete.

## How can I provide feedback or report bugs?

The best way to provide feedback or report bugs is to open an issue on GitHub, directly. If you are a TestFlight user and prefer to submit feedback directly through TestFlight, please make sure to not anonymously submit questions that require a response. Apple does not provide any way for me to respond to anonymous feedback submitted through TestFlight.

There is also a [troubleshooting guide](/guides/mobile/troubleshooting) that may help you resolve common issues.

## Will the macOS version be developed more?

You might have noticed you can install the mobile app on macOS devices with Apple Silicon. This is a neat feature of macOS where it will run the iPad version of the app, however it is not a first-class masOS application. The app will not be optimized for macOS, nor will it receive macOS-specific features, until the app is more stable and feature-complete on mobile platforms. Eventually, though, it is on my radar.

## First-class support for other server types?

<Callout emoji="❓">
	What this refers to is support for other server types like Kavita, Komga, etc, through their own
	APIs, rather than through OPDS which has some limitations.
</Callout>

At this time, the mobile app only supports Stump servers natively. I am not strictly opposed to first-class support for other server types existing in the same application, but it would require **significant** development effort and comes with an exponential maintenance burden that I would not want to take on myself, to be honest.

I think the existing OPDS support gets you most of the high-level features you'd want from a non-Stump server, anyways.
