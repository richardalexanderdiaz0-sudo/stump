Frequently asked questions about the mobile app

## Pricing

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
	The price has yet to be determined and **subject to change**. I am trying to keep it as affordable
	as possible while still being sustainable for continued development. The current price range I'm
	considering is between $10 and $20 USD, which is comparable to similar apps in the market.
</Callout>

Once the app is more stable and feature-complete, it will be released as a paid app on both iOS and Android. The price is not finalized, but it will be a one-time purchase with **no required recurring fees or subscriptions** that otherwise gate features.

The app will remain free for alpha testers via TestFlight and Google Play, however it will be used as a testing ground for new features and changes before they are released to the public. Therefore, alpha testers should expect more bugs and instability compared to the paid version.

## Why React Native?

React Native is often criticized for its performance and reliability, but it has come a long way since its inception. Stump is primarily developed and maintained by a single person, so it is important to consider the trade-offs between performance and development overhead.

Regardless, I am confident that it is at least a good fit for Stump, as it is a relatively simple app with a focus on content consumption - which doesn't inherently require a lot of performance.

## Why don't my OPDS v1.2 catalogs work?

The mobile app only supports OPDS v2.0.

I recognize that there are many OPDS v1.2-compatible servers out there and that OPDS v2.0 is not widely adopted yet. However, I **really** don't like XML - at least not from the perspective of a developer. I don't want to have to maintain an XML client for the app. There are lots of really great v1.2-compatible apps out there, so I'm only supporting OPDS v2.0.

That said, I will consider outside contributions that successfully wrangle v1.2 vs v2.0 client-side negotiations without breakage. Please reach out if you're interested in contributing!

## Will there be translations?

Yes! The app will be translated into multiple languages in the same way the web app is. I plan to start this effort once the app is more stable and feature-complete.

## How can I provide feedback or report bugs?

The best way to provide feedback or report bugs is to open an issue on GitHub, directly. If you are a TestFlight user and prefer to submit feedback directly through TestFlight, please make sure to not anonymously submit questions that require a response. Apple does not provide any way for me to respond to anonymous feedback submitted through TestFlight.
