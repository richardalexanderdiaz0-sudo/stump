# OPDS Compatibility

This page covers tested OPDS servers and known issues or limitations when using OPDS with the mobile app.

## Tested OPDS Servers

<Callout emoji="📣" type="info">
	If you have tested the app with a server not listed here, please let me know so I can add it to
	the list!
</Callout>

Excluding Stump itself, the following servers have been tested:

| Server                                     | Status | Progression | Notes         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| [Komga](https://komga.org/)                | ✅     | ✅          | -             |
| [Codex](https://github.com/ajslater/codex) | ✅     | ✅          | Codex v1.9.0+ |

## Limitations, Known Issues, and Future Improvements

The mobile app aims to be a fully compatible OPDS v2 client. However, since there aren't many client/servers in the space, and the mobile app is still very young, there are some limitations and known issues that will be addressed in future releases

### Search URL Templating

Some OPDS servers support templated search URLs, which allow clients to issue targeted search queries. An example templated URL might look like:

```
/opds/v2.0/search{?query, author, title, subject}
```

The idea is that the client can replace _any_ of the templated parameters with actual search values.

Currently, the mobile app only supports replacing a single `query` parameter in templated search URLs. This should function as a basic search, but more advanced searches that utilize the full templated options are not supported yet.
