# OPDS Compatibility

This page covers tested OPDS servers and known issues or limitations when using OPDS with the mobile app.

## Tested OPDS Servers

<Callout emoji="📣" type="info">
	If you have tested the app with a server not listed here, please let me know so I can add it to
	the list!
</Callout>

Excluding Stump itself, the following servers have been tested:

| Server                                     | Status | Progression | Notes         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| [Komga](https://komga.org/)                | ✅     | ✅          | -             |
| [Codex](https://github.com/ajslater/codex) | ✅     | ✅          | Codex v1.9.0+ |

## Progression

There exists a proposed standard for tracking reading progression in OPDS v2. If your OPDS server supports this feature, the mobile app will automatically attempt to sync your reading progression back to the server in most scenarios.

<Callout emoji="❌" type="info">
	At this time, only page-based OPDS progression tracking is supported. In other words, EPUB files
	are not able to sync progression yet. This will be addressed in a future release.
</Callout>

## Limitations, Known Issues, and Future Improvements

The mobile app aims to be a fully compatible OPDS v2 client. However, since there aren't many client/servers in the space, and the mobile app is still very young, there are some limitations and known issues that will be addressed in future releases

### EPUB Progression

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	This only applies to OPDS servers that support progression tracking. If you are using a Stump
	server, it does not apply since Stump uses its own custom API for progression syncing.
</Callout>

At this time, only page-based OPDS progression tracking is supported. In other words, EPUB files
are not able to sync back progression yet. This will be addressed in a future release.

### Search URL Templating

Some OPDS servers support templated search URLs, which allow clients to issue targeted search queries. An example templated URL might look like:

```
/opds/v2.0/search{?query, author, title, subject}
```

The idea is that the client can replace _any_ of the templated parameters with actual search values.

Currently, the mobile app only supports replacing a single `query` parameter in templated search URLs. This should function as a basic search, but more advanced searches that utilize the full templated options are not supported yet.
