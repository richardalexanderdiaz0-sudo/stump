# Configuration

This guide covers adding, editing, and deleting servers in the mobile app.

## Adding a Server

The process for adding a Stump server and an OPDS server is the same. The only difference is that an OPDS server requires a URL pointing to the root catalog for the feed

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	If you configure a Stump server as a dual-mode server, you may use the root URL for the Stump
	server instead of the catalog URL
</Callout>

<Steps>

#### Go to the Servers screen

This is the very first screen you will see when you open the app

#### Click the `+` button

The button is located in the top right corner of the screen

#### Select either `Stump` or `OPDS`

The very first field labeled `Kind` will allow you to select the type of server you are configuring. You may choose either `Stump` or `OPDS`. If choosing `OPDS`, you will need to specify the OPDS version, as well.

If you wish to configure a Stump server _with_ OPDS support, select `Stump` and then enable the `Enable OPDS` switch towards the bottom of the form

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	If a Stump server has OPDS enabled, it will enable v2.0 support automatically. OPDS v1.2 is not
	supported for dual-mode servers
</Callout>

#### Fill in the required fields

The form will have the following required fields:

- **Name**: A friendly name for the server
- **URL**: The URL of the server. If `OPDS`, this will be labeled `Catalog URL`
- **Auth**: The type of authentication to use

If you choose `Login` for auth, there will be no additional fields to fill in. If you choose `Basic`, you will need to provide a username and password. If you choose `Token`, you will need to provide a token

#### Fill in the optional fields

You may configure the following optional fields:

- **Custom Headers**: Any custom headers you wish to send with each request

You may enable/disable the following optional fields:

- **Enable OPDS**: If you are configuring a Stump server, you may enable OPDS support here
- **Set as default server**: If enabled, the app will take you into this server when you open the app instead of the root screen

#### Click `Add server`

</Steps>

## Editing a Server

Force press on a server in the list to bring up a context menu. Select `Edit` to edit the server.

The process for editing a server is the same as adding a server, so follow the same steps as above. The notable difference is that you may not name it the same as an existing server

## Deleting a Server

Force press on a server in the list to bring up a context menu. Select `Remove` to delete the server.

You will be presented with a confirmation dialog before the server is deleted. If the server is a dual-mode server, an additional warning will be presented.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	Any disk space used by the server will be freed up when the server is deleted. This includes any
	books downloaded from the server or cached data
</Callout>
