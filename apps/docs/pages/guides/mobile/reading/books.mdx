# EPUB Reader

The EPUB reader in Stump's mobile app is powered by Readium, providing a native reading experience for digital books. While still being refined, it offers essential reading functionality with customizable themes and settings.

## Layout and Navigation

The EPUB reader features a clean, minimal interface that focuses on the reading experience:

- **Center Tap**: Tap the center of the screen to show/hide the reader controls
- **Header Controls**: Exit the reader and access quick settings
- **Footer Controls**: Progress indicator and navigation tools

## Reader Settings

The EPUB reader provides several customization options accessible through the settings panel:

### Visual Themes

The reader includes several built-in themes for different reading preferences. There are too many to enumerate here, however something more notable than the defaults is that you can create your own custom themes.

A custom theme allows you to configure:

- Friendly name
- Background color
- Text color
- Highlight color

	Custom themes are stored locally on your device and are not synced across devices. If you would
	like to see more advanced options for this feature, please reach out
</Callout>

### Font Configuration

#### Font Size

Adjust the text size with a slider control to find the most comfortable reading size for your device and preferences.

#### Font Family

Choose from several default fonts optimized for reading:

- **System**: Use your device's default font
- **OpenDyslexic**: Designed to improve readability for people with dyslexia
- **Literata**: A serif font optimized for digital reading
- **Atkinson Hyperlegible**: Designed for enhanced legibility and accessibility
- **Charis SIL**: A Unicode-based font family supporting a wide range of languages
- **Bitter**: A slab serif font designed for comfortable screen reading

#### Line Height

Adjust the spacing between lines of text for improved readability and comfort.

### Display Settings

#### Brightness Control

Fine-tune the screen brightness directly within the reader without affecting your device's global brightness setting.

#### Publisher Styles

Toggle whether to respect the original formatting and styles defined by the book's publisher, or use your custom theme settings throughout.

## Navigation Features

A sheet accessible from the header controls provides a few different categories of information and navigation options:

### Book Overview

View book metadata including:

- Cover image
- Title and author information
- Publisher details
- Book summary (when available)

### Table of Contents

Access the book's table of contents to jump to specific chapters or sections. The table of contents preserves the hierarchical structure of the book.

### Annotations

The annotations tab lists all types of annotations you've made in the book, including:

- Highlights
- Notes
- Bookmarks

There is a tab at the top for filtering by just specific types, but the default is to show all annotations at once

## Progress Tracking

Your reading progress is automatically saved and synced across devices when connected to a Stump server.

Like the image-based reader, the EPUB reader also supports:

- **Incognito Mode**: Read without saving progress or location data
- **Reading Timer**: Track time spent reading (with sync support for Stump servers)
