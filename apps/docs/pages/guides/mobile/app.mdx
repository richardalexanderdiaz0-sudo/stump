# Mobile App

<Callout emoji="🚧">
	The mobile app is currently an early **alpha** release. Please be aware that these sections of the
	documentation subject to change or might not be fully implemented yet
</Callout>

The Stump mobile app is a cross-platform application built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

## Core Features

The mobile app is a bit more trimmed down in scope compared to the built-in web app, at least with respect to management features. The app aims to provide a more focused experience, being tailored for on-the-go, mobile use cases. Here are some highlighted features available today:

- Multi-server configurations, so you can connect to multiple Stump instances
- OPDS support, so you can use the app with other OPDS-compatible services
- Basic readers for all supported book formats (e.g., CBZ/CBR, EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- A built-in file browser similar to the web app
- Downloads and offline reading, so you don't need an active internet connection
- Bidirectional sync between offline and online reading (progression, highlights, bookmarks, etc.)
- A "Stump-free" experience that only shows OPDS catalogs if you prefer to not use a Stump server
- Rich reading features, such as bookmarks, annotations, customizable color themes, and more

## Planned Features

There are many features planned for the mobile app, including but not limited to:

- Customizable tap zones
- Per-annotation highlight color customization
- Full feature support for major non-management Stump features
- iOS/Android widget support

The app will follow the server as certain large-scale features are added, such as [book clubs](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/120), [journaling](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/866), etc.

## Getting the App

The app is currently available for alpha testing on both iOS and Android.

If you're using an iOS device, you can join the [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/a4srR634) to download the app. While you may be able to download the app for macOS (it seems to run the iPadOS version), please note that it is not officially tested at this time.

If you're using an Android device, please either reach out to me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as) or [email](mailto:oromei@proton.me) and send me your Play Store email, or check back here for updates on public availability. I unfortunately only have access to a closed beta on Google Play at the moment.
